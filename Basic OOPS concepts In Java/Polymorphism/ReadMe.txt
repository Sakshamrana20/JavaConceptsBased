Polymorphism  is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
It is the ability of different classes to be treated as intances of a common super class.
It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of common base type.
Polymorphism is always achieved via behaviours of an object,
Properties of an object does not play any role in case of polymorphism.

       TYPES OF POLYMORPHISM :
                                 1. Compile time Polymortphism (Method Overloading).
                                 2. Run- time Polymorphism (Method Over riding).


Compile time Polymorphism (Method Over loading) =  It occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name
                                                   but different parameters.  The appropriate method to execute is determined at compile time based on
                                                   the number  and type of arguments.
Run - time Polymorphism (Method over Riding ) =    It occurs when a  subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined
                                                   in super class. The method to excute is determined at run time based on actual object type.


Because of polymorphism we have code reusability which allows us to write  more generic code that can operate on objects of different types.
It has flexibility which allows the same method to call to exhibit different behaviours based on the actual type of the object at run time.
