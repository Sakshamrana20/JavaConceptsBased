Encapsulation
It means wrapping up the data member and member function into a single unit  which is called class.
A CLASS is blue print or template for creating objects. it defines the properties(data member) and behaviours(method) that object of that class will have.

Example for encapsulation can be capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

we can create a fully encapsulated class by making all data members of that class private. Now will use setter and getter methods to set and get data.

In this way you have control over data. Lets say you want to set value of an id and that should not be  greater than 100 and also should not be negative. 
so we could write logic inside the setter method in that way only that data will be stored which we wanted.

It also help us to hide our data because other class will not be able to acces as all our data will be stored in data members and those data members will be private.
