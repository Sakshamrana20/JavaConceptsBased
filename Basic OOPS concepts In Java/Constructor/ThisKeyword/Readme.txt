This keyword holds the address of reference variable.

This always points to current object.
It is a reference variable which hold the reference id.

so what happens is that whenver class level variable and local variable both have same name then the concept or you
could say a problem arises which is named DATA SHADOWING.
Now whenever there are same names variable then the priority goes to local variable
so by this keyword which points the current object and has reference id of it we can access or store at class level variable.

There are two types of this keyword 

                              1. Implicit this
                              2. Explicit this

1. Implicit this = when you don't write this keyword but it's understod that the variable or method to the current object is called or it belonged to.
2. Explicit this = It is when you need to clarify to the java compiler that the variable is class level. This is done when data shadowing is arising.
